# crossfit_analysis
The statistical analysis of the Crossfit Kaggle dataset done for a Bar-Ilan course in Statistics

## Data
This work was based on the following data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/crossfit-athletes 

## Analysis 
The repository contains a pdf that explains all the finding and the techniques used

## Code
The code is written in python and it is based on pandas, scipy and sklearning. The analysis is done in the def `load_data` function and it includes all the code needed for the paper. I suggest using an iteractive tool like spyder or jupyter nodebook and running the parts one by one.
